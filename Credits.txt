******** Astartes Implants   *********
*************************************


Mods I tinkered with to help me built my own. 

Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering by Ykara
DESurgerys, A Dog Said by kaptain_kavern

Kaptain Kavern and TrashMan for initiating the 40k hype in A14.

MayPeX for the awesome Apothecarium and the other Textures.

Descriptions of the Implants are taken mainly from the Deathwatch RPG Sourcebook
and other Sources by GamesWorkshop.
